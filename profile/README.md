## Welcome

This Github Organization is to collaborate, share, and ensure the reproducibility of the data science practiced by the NSF INCLUDES Alliance: Alliance Supporting Pacific Impact through Computational Excellence (ALL-SPICE) (Award Number 2217242)

### All-SPICE Alliance Vision Statement

*Harness the data revolution* in support of sustainability, prosperity, and social justice in the Hawaii-Pacific region, placing *Pacific data in Pacific hands*.

### How to Navigate

The repositories are project-based, with the beginning of the repository indicating collaboration:

  - For example: The ALL-SPICE Alliance partners with [CIFAL Honolulu](https://chaminade.edu/cifal-honolulu/). The repositories/projects that fall under this partnership begin with CIFAL-Honolulu. This is followed by the project name, SDG-ML (Sustainable Development Goal - Machine Learning). All the code, data, and analysis for this project can be found in the CIFAL-Honolulu-SDG-ML repository

Each repository will contain the following
  - A README file (similiar to this one) that indicates:
      - A description of the partnership 
      - The purpose of the project
      - How to navigate the repository
  - A *data folder* housing all the data for the project
  - An *analysis folder* housing all the code for the project
  - A *visualizations* folder housing final visualizations of the project

### You can expect 

  - Clean, well-documented code
  - Contact information for project participants
  - Actionable, value-driven data science
